# **Analysis of place firing properties of CA1 place cells:**

The notebooks uses NeuroChat to extract (in batch) the following information from single units (place cells):

<ul>
  <li>Location of the center of mass </li>

  <li>Place field size</li>

  <li>Number of spikes in place field</li>

  <li>Unit peak firing rate</li>
</ul>
